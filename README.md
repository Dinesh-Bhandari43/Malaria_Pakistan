# Malaria_Pakistan
In this project, we are analysing the association between Malaria cases and ambient temperature for two endemic districts in Pakistan. Using the exposure-response function derived from the data and future increase in ambient temperature for the study locations, we have projected future climate-attributable Malaria burden in Pakistan under the intermediate and very high emission scenarios. This work is under review with Epidemiology and Infection.
